# Elite_Ambitionz
A social networking experiment


This experiment is to value the life line of people's ambitions
The goal is to fundamentally accept people's true concern and views 
they can talk almost about anything from politics to the well being of changes to bullying in school.

We take extremely important the issues of people views which includes but are not limited to race, religion, sexual orientation
and the likes thereof, harrassment, etc.

So I am implementing a cease fire on all conversations that leads up to hate, vulgar language, and exploitations of a person
or their views as mentioned before
